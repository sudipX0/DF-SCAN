# DF-SCAN  
A deepfake video detection system that determines whether a video is **real** or **fake** using deep learning.  
The system analyzes both spatial (frame-level) and temporal (sequence-level) patterns to identify manipulations and display authenticity results with confidence scores and visual cues.

## Experimental Architecture  
Hybrid **CNN + LSTM** or **CNN + Transformer** architecture that captures:  
- **Spatial inconsistencies** (per-frame CNN features)  
- **Temporal correlations** (LSTM/Transformer sequence modeling)

## Observations

### **Scaling Up Helps**  
Each dataset expansion improved overall accuracy and ROC-AUC; the model exhibits continued growth, with performance nearing saturation at 1000 videos.

### **REAL Class Recovery**  
- LSTM Model 6: 0.87 F1  
- Transformer Model 8: 0.82 F1  
- Celeb-DF fine-tune: 0.44 F1  

The Transformer model slightly trades some AUC for improved REAL/FAKE balance and robustness across fake types.

### **High AUC**  
- LSTM Model 6: 0.9830  
- Transformer Model 8: 0.9510  

Both models are highly capable, but the Transformer offers more balanced predictions for real videos.

### **Fake Class Robustness**  
All models consistently achieve 94â€“100% across all fake types. Transformer Model 8 maintains strong generalization without biasing toward a single fake category.

### **Domain Transfer Risk**  
Celeb-DF fine-tuned Model 7 shows that naive fine-tuning can hurt REAL recall due to domain shift and dataset imbalance.

### **Best Model Recommendation**  
- **Use CNN + Transformer (Model 8) for deployment** on FaceForensics++.  
- Strong balanced REAL/FAKE detection (accuracy 0.95, AUC 0.951).  
- Excellent per-fake type generalization.  
- Optional fine-tuning can be considered **with class-balancing strategies** for further REAL recall improvement.
