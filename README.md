# DF-SCAN  
A deepfake video detection system that determines whether a video is **real** or **fake** using deep learning.  
The system analyzes both spatial (frame-level) and temporal (sequence-level) patterns to identify manipulations and display authenticity results with confidence scores and visual cues.

---

## Experimental Architecture  
Hybrid **CNN + LSTM** architecture that captures:  
- **Spatial inconsistencies** (per-frame CNN features)  
- **Temporal correlations** (LSTM sequence modeling)
