        - /csv: 10 csv files with metadata about videos.
        - /DeepFakeDetection: 1000 deepfake videos generated using Googleâ€™s DeepFakeDetection method.
        - /Deepfakes: 1000 deepfake videos generated by early DeepFake algorithms.
        - /Face2Face: 1000 deepfake videos manipulated using Face2Face method (expression swap).
        - /FaceShifter: 1000 deepfake videos with high-quality identity swaps using FaceShifter model.
        - /FaceSwap: 1000 deepfake videos with identity swaps with FaceSwap algorithm.
